## PK-Sim® &amp; MoBi® (OSPS®) workshop on integrating PBPK with QSP for in-silico first-in-man PD predictions 

esqLABS is running a one-day hands-on **PK-Sim® & MoBi®** workshop on **integrating PBPK with QSP for in-silico first-in-man PD predictions** on **Monday 28 May**. The workshop covers the concepts and application of combining PK-Sim, MoBi and R to build your very own digital platforms for the prediction of clinical trial outcomes by leveraging physiological and mechanistic knowledge to translate early in-vitro and preclinical outcomes to the clinic. During hands-on exercises you will learn how to:

- [x] Build a PBPK model in PK-Sim and compare to observed data
- [x] Integrate mechanism-based pharmacodynamics in MoBi
- [x] Simulate and analyze your PBPK-QSP model in R

This workshop will be held jointly by consultants & scientists from esqlabs GmbH and Bayer AG with extensive experience in the use of **PK-Sim® & MoBi®** in all application areas. 

While the workshop does not require any prior experience with PK-Sim® & MoBi®, many topics will be of interest even for advanced users.

**Cost**: 300 EUR. Academics & non-profit organization employees 180 EUR to cover the room, lunch and coffee breaks. 

For more information and registration, please email Stephan on workshop@esqLABS.com.

The workshop is currently restricted to 30 participants.
